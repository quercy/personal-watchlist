# personal-watchlist
Tools, articles, technology that I want to keep my eye on. 

I'll try to keep this up to date and organize it for others and myself to digest. My hope is to keep these lists from getting too long but should be a good glimpse into what I find interesting, think is upcoming, or just generally useful.
